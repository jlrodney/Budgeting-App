# Budgeting App

This is an application where a user can input its expenses by providing a description, an amount, an optional note and a date. These expenses are then shown on the dashboard and saved onto a database (firebase). This app is mobile friendly and should scale depending on the size of the screen. 

## Motivation 
This project was undertaken as a learning exercise to improve my skills in React with Redux. 

## Build status
This app is currently deployed at [https://budget-organiser.herokuapp.com/](https://budget-organiser.herokuapp.com/).

## Further Work
- User login/authentication so that each user only sees their own information.
- Summary components of expenses.


## Tech
This application uses React with Redux and is tested using Jest and Enzyme. 

## Installation
